# Analog-Filter
This project is a step-by-step journey into building a Wien Bridge Oscillatorâ€“based system, combining analog circuits, digital control, and PCB design. The goal is to start from a simple sine wave generator and gradually expand the project into a complete mini function generator with visualization.
