# Analog + Digital Oscillator Project

ðŸš€ This repository documents my step-by-step journey of building a complete **oscillator-based electronics project**, starting from basic simulation blocks and moving towards a fully working prototype.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Roadmap
- [x] Stage 1: Wien Bridge Oscillator (sine wave generator) âœ…
- [ ] Stage 2: Audio Amplifier (speaker driver)
- [ ] Stage 3: Frequency Control (potentiometer / digital control)
- [ ] Stage 4: Visualization (LED bargraph / LCD)
- [ ] Stage 5: Integration (mini function generator system)
- [ ] Stage 6: PCB Layout (Altium Designer)

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Proteus** â†’ Circuit simulation & testing
- **Altium Designer** â†’ PCB design (new step, key part of this project)
- **MikroC / Arduino IDE** â†’ For control & programming (later stages)
- **Hardware** â†’ Final prototyping

## ðŸŒŸ Key Factor
A key factor in this project is that I am introducing a **new design tool (Altium Designer)** into my workflow.  
This allows me to transition from **academic simulations** to **professional PCB layouts**, which will be included in later updates.

## ðŸ“¸ Progress
- Schematics and simulations (Proteus)  
- PCB layout drafts (Altium Designer)  
- Screenshots, notes, and explanations for each block  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
At the end, I want to have a working **oscillator & audio visualization system**, simulated, prototyped, and designed in **Altium Designer** for PCB manufacturing.
## ðŸ”„ Updates
This project will be updated **often** as I make progress.  
Each time I complete a block, I will:
- Upload the new schematic (Proteus / Altium)
- Add simulation screenshots
- Update the checklist in the roadmap
- Push changes to GitHub

Stay tuned for regular updates ðŸš€
